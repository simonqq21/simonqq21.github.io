Simon Justin C. Que
Hello, I am Simon! I am a freelance backend and microcontroller systems developer. I am motivated by developing and optimizing computer systems to work seamlessly and efficiently. I am primarily interested in microcontrollers, IoT, electronics, automation, and robotics, but am also active in learning the latest advances and best practices in software development.
I do all main disciplines of software development and computer systems engineering, but mainly excel in backend development, data science, and microcontroller development. I am continuously improving and learning in frontend development and AI as I continue working on my projects.">
