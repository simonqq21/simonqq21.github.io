          Hello, I am Simon! I am a freelance backend and microcontroller
          systems developer. I am motivated by developing and optimizing
          computer systems to work seamlessly and efficiently. I am primarily
          interested in microcontrollers, IoT, electronics, automation, and
          robotics, but am also active in learning the latest advances and best
          practices in software development. I do all main disciplines of
          software development and computer systems engineering, but mainly
          excel in backend development, data science, and microcontroller
          development. I am continuously improving and learning in frontend
          development and AI as I continue working on my projects.
