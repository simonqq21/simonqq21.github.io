# ESP8266 Based WiFi Controlled Two-Wheeled Car

    
# Introduction

This ESP8266 based WiFi controlled two-wheeled car is a project I created from scratch to familiarize with the ESP8266 microcontroller development. 

The project consists of a two-motored, two-wheeled car platform controlled by an ESP8266 microcontroller, which facilitates the movement of the car, switching miscellaneous electronics such as LEDs and a buzzer, serving a WiFi hotspot for clients to connect to, serving the user interface webpage to the browsers of connected devices, handling real-time websocket communication, and taking readings from the ultrasonic sensor. Once the car is powered on by connecting the battery pack connector, the ESP8266 serves an open WiFi hotspot for client devices such as mobile and desktop devices to connect. Once a client device connects to the ESP8266, the user interface can be accessed on the browser of the connected device. 



 and its WiFi stack, realtime websocket communication, ESP8266 HTTP webserver, basic front-end web development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and creating a simple mobile robot with a body, motors and motor controllers, battery packs, microcontroller, remote control system, sensors, and miscellaneous electronics like LEDs and buzzers.
